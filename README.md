# pl_calisthenics

Here i will describe on of the possible
ways to create programming language.

It will be simple language, but i want to try to do it
Turing completeness.
I will start from webpack configuration to be available to compile TypeScript.
I want to have two ways to handle language: compile or interpret.
So need to implement STD library, I/O interface for different compiling targets.
Probably in a process of development i will get some ideas and, of course, implement them.

Environment:

- node v12.8.0

P.S. I'm not pretend to the absolute true and rightness of my decisions. 
Just want to have some fun and improve my knowledges.
